		<h6>Definition:-</h6>
		<p>
			In cuisine, an omelette or omelet is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg). It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as cheese, chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.

		<h6>History:-</h6>
		<p>
			The earliest omelettes are believed to have originated in ancient Persia.According to Breakfast: A History, they were "nearly indistinguishable" from the Iranian dish kookoo sabzi.

			According to Alan Davidson,the French word omelette (French: […îm.l…õt]) came into use during the mid-16th century, but the versions alumelle and alumete are employed by the M√©nagier de Paris (II, 5) in 1393.Rabelais (Pantagruel, IV, 9) mentions an homelaicte d'oeufs,Olivier de Serres an amelette, Fran√ßois Pierre La Varenne's Le cuisinier fran√ßois (1651) has aumelette, and the modern omelette appears in Cuisine bourgeoise (1784).The ancient Romans also combined eggs with dairy products to create savory and sweet dishes.[citation needed]

			According to the founding legend of the annual giant Easter omelette of Bessi√®res, Haute-Garonne, when Napoleon Bonaparte and his army were traveling through southern France, they decided to rest for the night near the town of Bessi√®res. Napoleon feasted on an omelette prepared by a local innkeeper, and thought it was a culinary delight. He then ordered the townspeople to gather all the eggs in the village and to prepare a huge omelette for his army the next day.
